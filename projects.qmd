### Project 1

**Institution:** UC Irvine — ISI-BUDS Summer Institute in Biostatistics  
**Data:** Clinical dataset  
**Methods:** Logistic regression, model selection, interaction terms, VIF, prediction accuracy

During Summer 2025, I participated in the NIH-funded ISI-BUDS program at UC Irvine, working with researchers studying tuberculosis treatment outcomes in Botswana.

- Built logistic regression models using predictors such as HIV status, ART history, age, CD4 count, dataset origin, and substance use.  
- Explored interactions and variable importance to determine factors associated with favorable TB outcomes.  
- Presented research findings at the UC Irvine ISI-BUDS Symposium.


### Project 2

**Institution:** UCLA Department of Statistics — Stats 199 Research
**Mentor:** Prof. Rob Gould
Years of data: 2015–2023 (California TB surveillance)

My current research explores possible environmental risk factors for tuberculosis in California, specifically wildfire smoke and PM2.5 exposure.

Obtaining IRB approval and CITI training for use of public health surveillance data.

Planning to merge California TB case data with environmental datasets such as wildfire smoke (CalFire), PM2.5 (EPA), and risk scores (OEHHA).

Modeling severe versus non-severe TB outcomes using logistic regression, splines, and spatial maps in R.
